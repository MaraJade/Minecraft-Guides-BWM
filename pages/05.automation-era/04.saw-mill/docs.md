Now that you have some power, you can start using it. First, you should craft a Saw Mill. This can be crafted with Tanned Leather, which must be cut a few times with shears, and then crafted into a Leather Belt, and finally, into a Saw Mill. This Saw Mill must be automated (it cannot be used with the Hand Crank).

The Saw Mill can be powered from any side except the saw face:

You will know itâ€™s working by the noise it makes while running, and the particle effects coming from the saw. Place blocks in front of the saw blade to cut them:

Placing a hopper (attached to a chest) below the saw will cut down on the amount of entities in the world. Cutting Logs and Wood will result in the following:

* Wood
	* 4 Planks
	* 2 Sawdust
	* 1 Bark
* Planks
	* 2 Plank Siding
* Siding
	* 2 Plank Moulding
* Moulding
	* 2 Plank Corners
* Corners
	* 2 Gears
