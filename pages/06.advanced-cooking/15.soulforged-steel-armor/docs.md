Soulforged Steel armor is not only made within the Soulforged Steel Anvil, but has a much higher material cost and slows you down when wearing it. It has the positive trade off of higher durability than any other armor.

In addition to Soulforged Steel, you need Plate Armor. Generally, you need around 2 per armor craft, but this depends on the item you are crafting:
