This mod changes a lot of core Minecraft features. There are important features to know before you jump straight into this mod, as you might find yourself getting stuck. Crafting tools and expecting to find iron to make better tools is not as simple as it once was with vanilla.

### Better with Mod Manual
Unlike most mods, you will need to craft a Manual. Itâ€™s made with a gear and a book. This manual is a reference guide (think of it as a less detailed version of this guide, thats in-game). I suggest you read through it if you ever get stuck.
