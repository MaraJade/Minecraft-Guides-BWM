### What is this mod about?
Better With Mods (BWM) is a mod based around extending and enhancing vanilla Minecraft. BWM focuses on improving the core aspects of Minecraft through its three core modules. First is the Gameplay module, which directly extends the gameplay of Minecraft through additional blocks, items, foods and more. Next is the Tweak module, which adds small quality of life and balance changes. Finally is the Hardcore module, which directly changes the core balance of Minecraft. Together, these three modules massively overhaul the vanilla experience.

BetterWithMods is largely inspired by Better Than Wolves by FlowerChild. While the core ideas may be the same, many things are different between the two mods.

This mod is best played as an addon to vanilla Minecraft. The Better With Mods team have released a lightweight modpack called BetterWithModpack which adds more tweaks, which make Minecraft a little harder and more interesting. This mod is best played with no other tech mods, as it makes many of the systems and changes obsolete (the pack is very well rounded with vanilla).

This guide has been written in a custom modpack with no tweaks or config changes.

>>>>>  This guide will not have any crafting recipes in it. Please use [JEI](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jei?gameCategorySlug=mc-mods&projectID=238222), as some modpacks change crafting recipes.
