* Shears
	* You can shear creepers. This stops them from exploding and drops a creeper oyster (5% drop from non-sheared creepers). You can then kill the creeper with no issues and it will drop niter, which is used for crafting. 
	* Gunpowder drops are disabled by default
* Wooden Tools
	* Each craftable wooden tool has one use before it breaks.
	* The wooden axe, sword and hoe are not craftable.
