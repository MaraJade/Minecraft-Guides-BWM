This feature reworks how beacons function. Beacons no longer have any GUI. Instead, the effect of the beacon is dictated by the blocks under it.

With a few exceptions, beacons follow these tier rules:

| Tier | Total Blocks | Radius |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (3x3) | 9 | 20 Blocks |
| 2 (5x5) | 34 | 40 Blocks |
| 3 (7x7) | 83 | 80 Blocks |
| 4 (9x9) | 164 | 164 Blocks |

A Beacon base must consist of the same blocks, and the effect will differ based on the block used:


| Block | Effect |
|---|---|
| Glass or any unused modded beacon base	| Activates the beacon with no effect; used for decoration. |
| Emerald Block  | Causes all kills in the area to have the same effect as a looting enchant; goes up to Looting 4. |
| Lapis Block | Gives True Sight: a potion effect that spawns particles on blocks with light levels lower than 8. Useful for lighting up an area. |
| Diamond Block | Gives fortune to all players in the area; goes up to fortune 4. |
| Glowstone | Gives players night vision. |
| Gold Block | Gives players haste. |
| Slime Block | Gives players jump boost. |
| Concentrated Hellfire Block | Gives players fire protection. |
| Prismarine | Gives players water breathing. | 
| Sponge | Suffocates all air breathers, unless they are wearing a plate helmet. |
| Dung | Gives players nausea and poison unless they are wearing full plate armor. |
| Coal Block | Gives players blindness unless wearing a Plate Helmet. |

**Tier Exceptions**   
_Soulforged Steel_ - This Beacon allows the Player to set their spawn by right-clicking it with an empty hand.


|Tier | Radius |
|---|---|
| 1 (3x3) | 40 Blocks |
| 2 (5x5) | 80 Blocks |
| 3 (7x7) | Unlimited in the Overworld |
| 4 (9x9) | Unlimited across dimensions |

_Ender Block_ - This Beacon changes how Ender Chests work. Any Ender Chest not placed on this beacon acts as a normal chest. Ender Chests placed on specific levels of the beacon have different inventories.


| Tier | Access |
|---|---|
| 1 (3x3) | Shared Inventory in that dimension |
| 2 (5x5) | Another Shared Inventory in that dimension |
| 3 (7x7) | Global Shared Inventory |
| 4 (9x9) | Private Player Inventory |
