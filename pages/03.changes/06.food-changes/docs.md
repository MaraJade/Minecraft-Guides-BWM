* Cooking
	* Baked goods require the kiln, and soups require the cauldron.
* Fat Content
	* If you eat food that goes over your current hunger bar need, you will gain fat (which is indicated with a white outline on your hunger bar). This fat will only go down once your hunger is past it. It penalizes overeating, while also giving backup food.
	* Peckish
		* When under-fed. UI is slightly zoomed-out and walking speed is slower than normal.
	* Plump
		* A step down from ‘chubby’. Walking speed is a bit faster than chubby, but still slower than normal.
	* Chubby
		* A step down from ‘obese’. You can jump more but are a little bit slower.
	* Obese
		* Eating too much (fat over 8 hunger bars) will give you an obese debuff. This slows down walking speed and limits jumping.
