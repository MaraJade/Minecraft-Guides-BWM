* Bats
	* Bats drop bat wings when killed. These can be cooked or used as fishing bait.
* Breeding
	* You can breed animals together by dropping items onto them, rather than feeding them.
	* To breed chickens you must feed them chicken seeds.
* Cactus
	* No longer hurts skeletons.
* Carrying Weapons
	* Hostile mobs always drop the weapon they are holding when killed.
* Eggs
	* When an egg is thrown, there is a chance it will spawn a “Raw Egg,” which can be cooked and eaten.
* Endermen
	* Endermen in the End will now have a chance of carrying endstone and thus dropping it on death.
* Fleeing
	* If you have mobs caged up and you have a gap in your fence, they will attempt to flee.
	* Mobs will flee if you hit them or a nearby mob, or if you place or break a block in their view.
* Hunting Mobs
	* Hostile mobs hunt animals too. Zombies attack herd animals, spiders eat chickens, wolves will eat anything.
* Jungle Spider
	* Found in the jungle, these look like normal spiders but are smaller and have a green tinge.
	* When they attack, they give you poison and hunger debuffs.
* Mob Heads
	* You can collect mob heads using a refined battleaxe, or machinery such as an automated saw.
* Nether Mobs
	* Only spawn on Nether blocks, such as gravel, Netherrack, Soul Sand and nether bricks.
* Sheep
	* Sheep can mutate; shearing them resets their wool color to their natural color. Breeding them can produce all colors.
* Slimes
	* Slimes only appear on natural rock and soil in marsh areas.
* Witches
	* Only appear in swamps.
* Wolves
	* Once you have befriended wolves, you can feed them meat. After some time they will poop. This poop can be used as a brown colour, and is also used as a crafting reagent.
