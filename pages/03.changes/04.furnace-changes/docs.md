Furnaces have been reworked in BWM. Unlike vanilla, smelting ores and other items will not work.

* Ore
	* Smelting Ore in a furnace will no longer give you ingots, but instead will give you nuggets. 9 of these can be crafted into an ingot. Some recipes are changed to require nuggets rather than ingots to be more reasonable, such as iron buckets and flint and steel.
