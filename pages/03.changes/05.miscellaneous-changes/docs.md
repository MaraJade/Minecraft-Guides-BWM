* Armor
	* Armor now has a weight value. 
		* Light: wool and chainmail
		* Medium: leather
		* Heavy: gold, iron, diamond and soulforged
* Beds
	* You can no longer sleep or set spawn with a bed. Instead you must use a soulforge beacon.
* Bone Meal
	* Removes the ability to instant-grow crops with bone meal. Bone meal can still be used on farmland to increase crop growth speed.
* Brewing
	* Modifies and rebalances vanilla brewing recipes and makes potions stack up to 8.
* Death
	* When you die, you will spawn randomly within a 2000 block radius of the World Spawn.
* Fishing
	* Fishing Rods require being Baited with certain items to entice fish; they won’t nibble without it!
* Health
	* When you are very low on health, your jump height and speed are restricted.
* Jumping and Placing blocks
	* Can’t place blocks while jumping
* Mineshafts
	* Fences have been replaced with oak wood.
* Mystery Meat
	* Dropped by the player or villagers on death.
* Saplings
	* No longer instantly grow into trees; these now grow in stages.
* Structures
	* Structures are looted within a radius of spawn (by default 2000 blocks) and unlooted outside of that radius, encouraging exploration. Makes unlooted structures the only source of enchanting tables and brewing stands.
* Tilling
	* Till the ground with a hoe to get seeds.
* Torches
	* You only craft 1 torch per coal.
