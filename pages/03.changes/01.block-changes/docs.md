* Cobblestone
	* Stone variants (granite, andesite and diorite) drop into cobblestone.
* Dropper
	* Recipe has changed
* Floating Gravel/Sand
	* Walking on floating gravel or sand will now create a block update and force them to fall.
* Grass Slabs
	* These can be crafted with 2 piles of dirt. When placed next to grass or mycelium they will convert into grass slabs or mycelium Slabs when it spreads to them.
* Leaves
	* Using any kind of axe will break leaves quickly. The speed of this is dependant on the quality of the axe.
* Logs
	* Trying to break the very bottom block of any tree (the block nearest to the ground) will take a VERY long time. These blocks are classed as the “stump” of the tree, and should be harvested with an iron, gold or diamond pickaxe.
	* Breaking logs by hand will yield sawdust and bark, which are used as crafting reagents later in the mod.
* Melons
	* Melons have gravity; makes for cool automation abilities.
* Mob Spawner
	* Turn stone bricks and cobblestone into their mossy counterparts within an area around them.
* Nether Quartz
	* The default texture is now black

	* Breaking sand, dirt and gravel with bare hands will give you 3 piles of dirt/sand/gravel

	* 4 Piles of dirt, sand and gravel can be crafted into their respective blocks.
* Pistons
	* Requires a soul urn to make.
* Redstone Block

* Stakes
	* Decorative block that can help with measurements.
* Water
	* Can’t place water source blocks with buckets.
